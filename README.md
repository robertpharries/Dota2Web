# Dota2Web

This is the basis of a Dota 2 Statistics Web Application.

Similar in idea to major sites like https://www.dotabuff.com/ or https://www.opendota.com/, this project was built for me to learn the ASP.net C# framework with an Angularjs front end. 

The site in its current state pulls down the recent match history for a player's steam id, and then gathers relevant information about the matches listed such as their score, what hero they played, etc, and display's that in a table format for the user to see.

The site uses Angular tools, such as Route for routing subviews into the search page, and Materials for the Toolbar/Buttons used in the app.

Relies on the DotaApiManage repo to retrieve match information.
